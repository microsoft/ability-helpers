# Tabster

**Tab**index on **ster**oids

<Source code={"npm install --save tabster"} />

Managing focus and the keyboard is hard. In a nutshell tabster will help you:

* Implement common widget keyboarding patterns
* Stop losing focus to `body` because an element disappeared
* Manage groups of nested focusable elements
* Reduce `focus()` calls in your codebase
