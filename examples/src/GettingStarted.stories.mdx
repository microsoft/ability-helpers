# Getting started

## data-tabster

Tabster works as a [HTML5 data-\* attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes).
The value of the `data-tabster` attribute is a JSON string which will configure the way tabster will handle focus. Don't worry!
you definitely won't need to write all this down in the DOM by hand.

We provide a simple `getTabsterAttribute` helper to construct `data-tabster` safely. Below is a simple example for React JSX syntax. We will go more into detail
in the <LinkTo kind="API" story="createTabster"> API documentation </LinkTo>.

```jsx
const tabster = createTabster(window);

<div {...getTabsterAttribute({ root: {}})} />
```

You'll also be able to see the different APIs available under the <LinkTo kind="API" story="createTabster"> API documentation </LinkTo>.

## Framework support

Although Tabster was designed to be independent of the rendering framework, most of our examples and tests rely on JSX. This is because
Tabster's biggest customer uses React and it's really quite nice to be able to leverage JSX for less verbose code.

We make sure that the library itself can be used with any rendering framework or even native DOM.

## Root

The first thing you need to do with tabster is to define the root.
This will let Tabster know that it can manage the focus of all the children under root

```html
<body data-tabster="{'root':{}}">
    <!-- Rest of your page -->
</body>
```

If you want to gradually migrate an entire webpage to
Tabster, or if you only need Tabster for a particular part of the page, just set the root somewhere else.

```html
<body>
    <!-- Rest of your page, tabster doesn't care what happens here -->

    <div data-tabster="{'root':{}}">
        <!-- Focus is managed by tabster here -->
    </div>
</body>
```
